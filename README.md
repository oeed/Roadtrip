A roadtrip script for Just Cause 2 Multiplayer!

I spent most of the last test in the roadtrip faction and I have to say, I had a blast. However, there were a few problems.

1. The waypoint has to be reset every time someone joins or dies.
2. If the leader is AFK or messing around no one can do anything.
3. If someone's being a real pain they can't be banned.
4. It's hard to know if everyone's at the waypoint.
5. As the faction's script hasn't been released it's impossible anyway at the moment.

So, to solve these issues I made a script that fixes every single problem listed.

The waypoint is automatically reset when a player joins or dies. You can vote kick the leader, or anyone in fact, as long as you get either 50% of the members voting or 5 votes (which ever is lower). The leader can ban someone from the roadtrip, they will remained banned until the leader changes. I have implemented a label they says how many of the members are at (within 150m) the waypoint, also, if you enter /roadtrip list it will display how far they are from the waypoint. Other than that, most things are just like normal factions.

## Commands:

/roadtrip - Enter or leave the roadtrip
/roadtrip chat - Enter or leave the private roadtrip chat
/roadtrip votekick <player name> - Vote to kick another player
/roadtrip goto - Teleport to another player
/roadtrip gotowp - Teleport to the waypoint
/roadtrip list - List the players online and their distance from the waypoint

## Leader commands:

/roadtrip waypoint (or /roadtrip wp) - Sets the roadtrip waypoint
/roadtrip resign - Pass the leaderhsip to someone else
/roadtrip kick <player name> - Kick a player
/roadtrip ban <player name> - Ban a player
/roadtrip transfer <player name> - Pass your leadership to someone else

Note: /rt can be use in all case instead of /roadtrip


## Installation:

As with other scripts, download it and place it in your servers '/scripts' folder. Make sure you also have CommandManager installed!
